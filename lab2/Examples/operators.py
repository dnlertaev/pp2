print(10 + 5)


#Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))


#Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)


#Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
